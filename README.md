# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Credit risk analysis using scikit-learn and imbalance-learn on sample credit data. 

Credit risk is an inherent classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. 
This analysis aimed to build and evaluate various machine learning models to evaluate individual customer credit risk.

## Summary 
credit - risk is not an easy predict but we can see that easy ensemble adaboost has the highest accuracy. But Easy AdaBoost Classifier shows that there is high-risk (93%) and (93%). But overall i wouldnt recommend using this algorithms since the accuracy predict would lead to problem since the prediction is not accurate.
